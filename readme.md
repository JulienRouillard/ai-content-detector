AI-content-detector

This project builds a **binary text classification system** to distinguish between **human-written** and **AI-generated** text using a custom-labeled dataset.

---

## 📌 Objectives

> The goal is to detect whether a given text input was generated by a Large Language Model (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-4) or written by a human.

- Create robust features via preprocessing & embeddings
- Train and compare traditional ML models (with ensembling)
- Explore the impact of using BERT vs. custom features
- Provide a **simple API** to detect AI-generated text from:
  - a single sentence
  - a batch of sentences (via JSON file upload)

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python (3.10+)
- scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- BERT embeddings (via Hugging)
- FastAPI (for serving)
- Docker

## Dataset

We compile 16 193 contributions with a balance of 63% of IA generated content and 37% of human content. 
Another dataset of 2000 texts, balanced, has been used to test model on new data.

## Models & Approach

We explored two parallel approaches for feature extraction:

1. **Custom feature extraction** (non-BERT):
   - POS tags, syntactic features, text length, ponctuation, etc.
   - Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, VotingClassifier, StakingClassifier

2. **BERT embeddings**:
   - Pre-trained `bert-base-uncased` as sentence encoder
   - Classification using SVM, LightGBM, or stacking ensemble

We used **Hard Voting** and **Soft Voting** to combine models for better generalization.
